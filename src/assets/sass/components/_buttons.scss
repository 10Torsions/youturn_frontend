/**
* Note : Styling Material UI component 
*
* Material-UI uses inline styles for many of its components, which can override class styles due to higher specificity. 
* To ensure your styles take precedence, you might need to increase specificity in your SCSS. 
* One common way to do this is by repeating the class name
